## Restaurant Reviews Web App
I completed this as my fifth project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developed Nanodegree (FEND). This app allows users to view local restaurants in New York City. Users can find out the address (with a map), the hours, a description of the cuisine, and read the reviews for different restaurants. Users can also filter the restaurants by borough and type of cuisine. There is also limited accessibility to the site offline through caching.

### Specification
The code was given to me in working condition. I added Mapbox API codes, aria-labels for accessbility, and caching to improve the performance of the app.

### Instructions
You can run the code on a local server using python. In Git Bash, enter "python -m http.server 8000" and then open up localhost:8000 in a web browser to view the app in working condition.
